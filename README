TODO
====
- Check how we trace through lambdas. Specifically, arguments there is a pain.

Caveats
=======
- Current method uses an LRU cache that maps between a code object address (frame.f_code) to a trace level decision
  (to trace or not to trace, etc.).
  This is theoretically broken, since a code object might get freed and a new code object will get allocated on the 
  exact same address, leading us to think that we already have a trace decision for that code object when in fact we
  don't.
  After discussing it with Rotem, it appears that code objects will not get deallocated except if the code uses "eval",
  which for 99% of the code (and ours in particular) this is not the case so we don't need to worry about it.
- We don't support tuple arguments, but then again Python 3 won't support them either (PEP 3113).

Benchmarks and expectations
===========================

All benchmarks were done on the following setup:
- Ubuntu 12.10 x64
- Python 2.7.2
- 2 i7 L640 CPUs 2.13GHz
- 6GB RAM
- Transcend 128GB SSD

  - return 0 immediately when entering our greenlet_trace_func function.
  - 13% slower than no trace at all.

trace 1:
 - logging returns immediately (doesn't do anything)
 - This is the overhead we have to pay in Python for simply setting a profile function using setprofile.

trace 2: 
 - logging suspended (does thread storage + greenlet lookup but nothing more)
 - this means that the overhead on fetching a per-greenlet storage is ~5% using the "last frame" system

trace 3:
 - filter returns NO_TRACE

trace 4:
  - filter: accept src/izbox, reject izbox.utils.container and izbox.state_machine.fysom._is_base_string
  - cython fprintf to log file gid,depth,module,func,fname,line (not serializing args)

trace 5:
  - filter: accept src/izbox, reject izbox.utils.container and izbox.state_machine.fysom._is_base_string
  - cython fprintf to /dev/null gid,depth,module,func,fname,line (not serializing args)

trace 6:
  - same as trace 5, but no fprint at all.
  - call inspect.getargvalues on the frame for the call (not on return)

trace 7:
  - same as trace 6, but disabling gc when logging calls (so no gc will run in inspect.getargvalues).
  - looks like it makes things a bit worse

trace 8:
  - tracing commit 38b46426e961ea6d38727c6ed260f579957aefaa
  - output to syslog

Old Notes (not reflecting current code)
=======================================

trace 2 (old code):
  - old benchmark: 4.11, 3.8, 3.78, 4.15, 3.8  : avg 3.93 (~2.3% time inc)
  - filter: accept src/izbox
  - just take GIL

trace 3 (old code):
  - old benchmark: 4.82, 4.76, 5.44, 4.85, 5.43: avg 5.06 (~31.7% time inc)
  - filter: accept src/izbox
  - Python enqueue fname/line to array

tests/benchmark_test.py:
  - no setprofile: 0.7638 seconds for 1000000 iterations (~1309243 iters/sec)
  - current ctracing setprofile: 2.0446 seconds for 1000000 iterations (~489093 iters/sec)
  - slowdown: x2.67


Determining the current greenlet and thread
-------------------------------------------
1. First method tried: using API calls (PyGreenlet_Current(), etc.). Problem is that they require GIL and that makes
   them slow.

Some things noticed when experimenting:
- frame->f_back is 0 when switching to a new greenlet.
- frame->f_tstate correponds to a (posix) thread.
- thread id can be obtained by doing: frame->f_tstate->thread_id
